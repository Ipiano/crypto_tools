\section program_section Library Information 

\details Description:
This set of tools was created as a part of the requirement for the Cryptography
course at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. They utilize the general
cryptography at https://github.com/Ipiano/module_crypto which was created as part
of the same project.

The book for the course was  "Introduction to Cryptography with Coding Theory (2nd Edition) 2nd Edition" by
Wade Trappe and Lawrence C. Washington. This book was the main reference used for writing the library.

DISCLAIMER: These tools are not written to follow any specific cryptographic standards. They exist
to demonstrate an understanding of the concepts and theory which the subject is founded on.

\subsection vigenere_brief Vigenere Cipher Tool
The vigenere cipher tool can be used to encrypt and decrypt text, as well as 
attack encrypted text in an attempt to determine the key used to encrypt it

\subsection adfgx_brief ADFGX Cipher Tool
The ADFGX cipher tool can be used to encrypt and decrypt text using the German
ADFGX cipher and a default substitution matrix

\subsection affine_brief Affine Cipher Tool
The affine cipher tool can be used to encrypt and decrypt text, as well as 
attack encrypted text in an attempt to determine the a, b used to encrypt it

\subsection frequencey_brief Frequency Analysis Tool
The frequency analysis tool can be used to find the frequency of characters
in one or more texts.

\subsection bbs_brief Blum Blum Shub Cipher Tool
The Blum Blum Shub Cipher tool can be used to encrypt and decrypt text using a one-time pad.
The one-time pad of bits is generated using the Blum Blum Shub pseudo-random number generation
algorithm.

\subsection des4_brief Simplified DES Tool
The book used for the course described a simplified version of the DES which uses 4-rounds and operates on
blocks of 12 bits. The des4 tool can be used to encrypt and decrypt text using this method, as well as attack
the same algorithm which is encrypting text using 3 or 4 rounds.

\subsection des64_brief Full DES Tool
The des64 tool is the full 64-bit DES. It can be used to encrypt or decrypt text in ECB mode.

\subsection rsa_brief RSA Tool
The RSA tool can be used to generate RSA public and private key pairs, as well as use those
pairs to encrypt and decrypt texts.

\section compile_section Building the Tools
Each tool can be built with the command 
\verbatim 
make
\endverbatim
This will generate a release version of the tool in [tool directory]/release. To build a debug version in [tool directory]/debug,
use the command 
\verbatim
make BUILD_TYPE=debug
\endverbatim

\subsection depend Dependencies
Both the RSA tool and the Blum Blum Shub cipher tool require the GNU Multi-Precision Library (GMP).

This entire repository requires the cryptography module found at https://github.com/Ipiano/module_crypto as a submodule.
If you did not pull this tools repository with the --recurse-submodules flag, you will need to update the submodule with
\verbatim
git submodule init
git submodule update
\endverbatim

\subsection usage Using the Tools
Implementation and background details for the different tools are found in a couple of sections of this documentation. The Implementation
details can be found on a per-file bases in the 'Files' section of the documentation. Details about the theory of the tools and
building/usage, look under the 'Related Pages' section.
