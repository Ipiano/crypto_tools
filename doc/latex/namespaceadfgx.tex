\subsection{Detailed Description}
Contains all library code for the A\+D\+F\+GX cipher. 

This includes only the A\+D\+F\+GX transformer type

The A\+D\+F\+GX cipher is a code which was developed by the Germans during World War 1. The cipher has four steps to encrypt a text
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Using the matrix below, substitute a pair of letters from \mbox{[}adfgx\mbox{]} for each letter of the text
\item Write the substituted text under the key in column, going from left to right
\item Re-\/order the columns so the letters of the key are in alphabetical order
\item Write the columns (from top top bottom) from the left to the right Decryption using the cipher follows the same pattern, but in reverse. To keep things secure during the war, the initial substituion matrix was changed regularaly, along with the key.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Substitution matrix \begin{DoxyVerb}    A  D  F  G  X
   --------------
A | p  g  c  e  n
D | b  q  o  z  r
F | s  l  a  f  t
G | m  d  v  i  w
X | k  u  y  x  h
\end{DoxyVerb}


During the war, this cipher was thought to be very difficult to crack, but it was broken by the French cryptanalyst Georges Painvin. After a couple of ciphertexts were recovered within a short period of each other, he made the assumption that they had the same substitution matrix and key. With this assumption, he tried writing out the text as if he were decrypting using various key lengths. If the beginnings of the original messages were similar, then when the key length was correct, they would have a large number of matches at the tops of the columns. After the key length was identified, the columns were ordered different ways, and for each way the problem became a simple frequency analysis away from decryption.
